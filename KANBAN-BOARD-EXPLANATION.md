# **Kanban Board Explanation**  

## **1. Definition of a Kanban Board**  
A **Kanban board** is a visual workflow management tool used to track tasks across different stages of a process. It helps teams manage work efficiently by providing a clear overview of ongoing tasks, bottlenecks, and priorities. The board consists of **columns representing task progress** and **cards representing individual tasks**.  

## **2. How Our Board Visualizes Workflow**  
Our Kanban board uses multiple columns to represent different stages of task completion. The columns include:  
- **To Do:** Tasks that are planned but not yet started.  
- **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Testing:** Tasks undergoing Quality Assurance (QA).  
- **Done:** Completed tasks ready for deployment or review.  

By **moving task cards between columns**, the team gets a real-time visual representation of workflow progress.  

## **3. Limiting Work-In-Progress (WIP) to Avoid Bottlenecks**  
To maintain efficiency, our board **limits Work-In-Progress (WIP)** by setting a **maximum of three tasks per column** (except for "Done").  
- This prevents **task overload** and **ensures focused work**.  
- If a column exceeds its WIP limit, the team must **resolve existing tasks before adding new ones**, preventing bottlenecks.  

## **4. Supporting Agile Principles**  
Our Kanban board aligns with Agile principles by enabling:  
- **Continuous delivery:** Work is completed in small increments and moved forward smoothly.  
- **Adaptability:** The team can **reprioritize tasks in real-time** based on project needs.  
- **Efficiency:** The WIP limit **reduces multitasking**, ensuring high-quality work.  
- **Collaboration:** Team members can see what others are working on, promoting **transparency** and **accountability**.
