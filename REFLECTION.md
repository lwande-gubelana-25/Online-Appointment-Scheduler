## **Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template**  
One of the main challenges I faced was understanding the entire assessment process and how to customize the Kanban board effectively. Some key difficulties included:  
- **Choosing the Right Template:** GitHub provides different project templates, such as **Basic Kanban**, **Automated Kanban**, and **Automated Kanban with Reviews**. Deciding which one best suited the project requirements was challenging.  
- **Understanding Workflow Customization:** I had to ensure the **columns, labels, and automation rules** aligned with Agile principles while keeping the workflow simple and clear.  
- **Setting Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits:** Initially, it was unclear how to **balance task allocation** and prevent overload without slowing down progress.  


### **Key Takeaways**  
- **GitHub Projects** is best for **development teams already using GitHub**, as it integrates directly with issues and pull requests.  
- **Trello** is more **user-friendly** and highly customizable, but lacks deep automation and development integration.  
- **Jira** is powerful for **Agile teams** with complex workflows but has a **steeper learning curve**.  

## **Final Thoughts**  
Through this process, I gained a better understanding of **how Kanban boards improve project management**. Although I struggled with the assessment process at first, working through GitHubâ€™s features helped me learn about **workflow visualization, WIP limits, and Agile methodologies**.
