# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Balancing stakeholder needs was challenging due to conflicting priorities. For instance:
- Doctors preferred fewer appointments for better patient care, while hospital admins wanted maximum scheduling efficiency.
- IT support prioritized security and system uptime, whereas patients desired a seamless and quick booking experience.
- Insurance providers required strict verification, which could slow down the booking process.
  
To address these conflicts, a compromise-based approach was applied, ensuring:
- Automated scheduling reduced manual errors for receptionists.
- Security measures (MFA, encryption) balanced usability and data protection.
- Reporting tools provided insights to hospital admins while respecting doctor preferences.
